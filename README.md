## About Me
Hello! I’m currently a first-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. With a deep passion for coding and problem-solving, I’m always eager to improve my programming skills and apply them to real-world challenges. I have a solid understanding of C and am expanding my knowledge of Python, particularly in areas like software development, process automation, and efficient data handling.

As I continue my studies, I’m excited to explore subjects such as programming, databases, and system analysis, to better understand how technology fosters innovation. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can share ideas, contribute to projects, and further develop my skills. Whether through coding challenges, hands-on projects, or internships, I’m always looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge and stay current with emerging technologies.

Outside of academics, I enjoy experimenting with new coding projects, diving into technological advancements, and expanding my expertise in software development. My goal is to build a strong foundation in Information Systems and contribute to solutions that enhance efficiency and drive success in the tech industry. I’m eager for the opportunities ahead, ready to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact!
